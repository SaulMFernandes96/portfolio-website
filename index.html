          <div class="text">
            <h2> About me </h2>
            <p>I am an ecotoxicologist with international experience in assessing the environmental impact of chemical substances, particularly pesticides, on terrestrial ecosystems. My work has taken me across multiple countries, allowing me to engage in diverse research projects, collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, and develop a broad perspective on environmental risk assessment of chemicals.</p>

            <p>I recently completed my PhD at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where I investigated the effects of pesticides on soil microarthropods, using approaches that ranged from standard toxicity testing to metabolomics and field experiments. Before that, I worked as a research assistant at <a href="https://www.fc.up.pt/GreenUPorto/en/" target="_blank">GreenUPorto</a> in Portugal, focusing on conventional and nano-formulated pesticides and deriving soil screening values for metals using natural soils. I have also conducted temporary assignments at <a href="https://ecos.au.dk/en/researchconsultancy/themes/climatic-stress-lab" target="_blank">Aarhus</a> University in Denmark and <a href="https://ect.de/" target="_blank">ECT Oekotoxikologie</a> in Germany, gaining hands-on experience with field and laboratory ecotoxicology under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions and Taxonomy of Collembola extracted from natural soils.</p>

            <p>My expertise spans both terrestrial and aquatic ecotoxicology, with experience in low-tier tests with terrestrial ecotoxicological tests (e.g., Collembola, earthworms, and enchytraeids) and aquatic toxicity assessments (e.g., aquatic plants and water fleas). I have designed microcosm studies with several species of Collembola and I have also designed field experiments to test the potential effects of sequential mixtures of pesticides.</p>

            <p>Beyond research, I thrive on collaboration—whether it’s teaming up with experts from different fields, mentoring students, or contributing to outreach projects like <i><a href="https://insideoutside.nl/Living-Soil#:~:text=Studio%20Lecture%202023%3A%20Lecture%20on%20Symbiotic%20underground%20networks%20given%20by%20Justin%20Stewart%2C%20evolutionary%20ecologist%20/%20VU%20Amsterdam%20and%20Saul%20Fernandes%2C%20ecotoxicologist%20and%20collembola%20expert%20/%20VU%20Amsterdam." target="_blank">Living Soil</a></i>, where I advised on soil biodiversity. I enjoy taking complex scientific insights and applying them to practical challenges, whether in environmental risk assessment, sustainable land management, or broader ecosystem protection.</p>
